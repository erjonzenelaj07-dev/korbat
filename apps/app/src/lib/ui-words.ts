/**
 * The words of korbat's own components and of this sub-project's screens (UI design, sections 1.5 and 8.1), kept out
 * of the markup so a later translation is mechanical: a test of a11y.test.tsx refuses a bare sentence in src/app and
 * src/components. Keys are written as the design's word tables write them (`offline.title`, `feed.loading`); words no
 * table keys take a key of the same shape. A template holds `{name}` where fill() puts a value. Words of an area that
 * has a words module of its own (moderation, standing, orders, Explore, the public pages, the terms) stay there.

/**
 * Smoke test of the auth and social modules in a running Compose stack, through Caddy.
 *
 * 1. The web page's CSP allows the Turnstile widget.
 * 2. The staff console's site (--console): its page answers with the console's CSP, exactly, and
 *    Cache-Control: no-store, no-transform. /api/staff/me answers 404 on the app's site, from Caddy itself,
 *    and, signed out, 401 staff_session_required on the console's, so the API has the console on there.
 *    The console's case routes (the overview, the queue, a case, the appeals) answer the same two ways, and
 *    the console's site answers the app's own moderation routes with 404 itself.
 * 3. Signed out, Explore answers a page that parses; its ranking is computed within a minute (the refresh
 *    job runs a round at start), and by the answer's own Date header it is less than 11 minutes old.
 * 4. Password sign-in for an unknown email returns invalid_credentials (argon2 runs inside the image).
 * 5. A throwaway native-app account signs up with an emailed code read from Mailpit and onboards.
 * 6. /api/me answers for it.
 * 7. It posts, the post appears in the public Latest timeline, and its profile counts one post.
 * 8. It uploads a JPEG carrying a GPS position, waits until it is ready, and posts it without text. The
 *    original upload is gone, no fingerprint of it is stored while MEDIA_MATCH is off (3d Task 7), and large.webp is
 *    served to anyone as a fresh WebP without metadata.
 * 9. A symlink to /proc/self/environ, planted in the store from inside the worker, is refused with 404.
 * 10. Deleting the post stops the image being served, and its folder leaves the store.
 * 11. The worker has only a loopback interface and a 768 MiB memory limit, and has never restarted.
 * 12. With --worst-case, flat-colour files at the pixel caps (48 MP 16-bit interlaced PNG, 48 MP
 *     progressive JPEG, 48 MP GIF, 16 MP AVIF) all become ready without the worker being OOM-killed or
 *     restarted, and its memory peak is printed. Run it after every sharp upgrade.
 * 13. The grant-role CLI makes it a moderator, and its session stops working.
 * 14. A second throwaway account (the first one's session is gone by now, and a deleted account could not
 *     be granted a role) edits its bio, changes its handle, reports the first account's post under a rule
 *     (its own list of reports shows the report undecided, and no decision is about it), downloads its
 *     export as a ZIP whose export.json ends with the moderation member holding that report, posts, and
 *     deletes itself with a code read from Mailpit and its handle typed; afterwards its profile is not
 *     found, its session is gone, and its post has left the Latest timeline.
 * 15. Signed out, a notice that the first account's post is illegal is taken through the app's site with the
 *     human check: it answers a reference and a token. The status page opens with that token and shows the
 *     post's link, undecided, and the contact as given; another token finds no notice. The receipt arrives in
 *     Mailpit under the reference, and the token in its link opens the same page with the address not yet
 *     confirmed. Nothing here decides the case: a decision needs a staff key.
 * 16. With --push (3f, the stack under the Compose profile notify): the phones' push site answers 404 itself to ntfy's
 *     /v1/config, /v1/stats and /v1/account and to a publish, and hands a topic's subscription to ntfy, which refuses
 *     it without a user (403); from inside the ntfy container, on the push network, the app's and the console's sites
 *     answer 403. The contact point's routes (/api/staff/contact) stand behind the console's two doors like the case
 *     routes, in step 2.
 * 17. 3f: a post's page (/post/<id>) answers the app's shell with 200 while the post is public and the same bytes, with
 *     the same security headers, with 404 once its author deleted it, and 404 for a post that does not exist or a
 *     malformed id: Caddy asks the API's status route, GET /api/posts/<id>/status, which answers 204 or 404 with no body.
 * 18. With --closed (3f, the stack started with APP_SITE=closed, as for a restore): every path of the app's site, the
 *     API's included, answers 503 with Caddy's one sentence, the console's site still serves its page, and nothing else
 *     runs, since nothing else can be reached through the app's site.
 * 19. 3d Task 4: GET /api/public/facts answers no-cache and names every tool off (the R1 check, the comparison with
 *     known material, the edge and the head's witness). A status code proves nothing about the two public pages, since
 *     the web export is one page and Caddy answers every unknown path with its shell: so the lead sentences of the rules
 *     page and of the transparency page are looked for in the bundle Caddy serves under /_expo/, which proves they were
 *     built in (the app's render tests prove the pages). An app test holds the two sentences here to the pages' own.
 * 20. UI Task 3: the app's page and the files it loads first, as Caddy serves them: / answers 200 with no-cache;
 *     /theme-boot.js, the script that paints the reader's theme before the bundle, answers 200 with no-cache like the
 *     page; the first font file the entry bundle names (a hashed /assets/__node_modules/@fontsource-variable/... woff2)
 *     answers 200 with public, max-age=31536000, immutable; and a post's page answers 200 while the post is public and
 *     404 for a post that does not exist (step 17 checks the rest of the post's page).
 *
 * Runs only against a local Docker context. Needs API_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY set to Cloudflare's always-pass test secret and API_SMTP_URL pointing
 * at Mailpit, and API_CONSOLE_ORIGIN naming the --console address. Makes its images with the sharp the worker uses.
 * Tries a Turnstile refusal again for up to a minute, since outbound calls can stall. Prints no codes or tokens.
 *
 * Every run leaves its first account, by then a moderator, and one open case on that account's post, in the lane
 * that is read last, with a report and a notice that no run can decide. One network may run it five times an hour
 * and twenty times a day: its two sign-ups count against the hourly sign-up limit, and its signed-out notice
 * against the limits of reports sent without an account.
 *
 * Usage, from the repo root:
 *   node scripts/smoke-auth-stack.mjs --base http://localhost:8080 --console http://localhost:8090 \
 *     --mailpit http://localhost:58025 --terms draft-2026-09 [--worst-case] \

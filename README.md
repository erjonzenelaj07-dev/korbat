## Dev quick start
```bash
pnpm install
node scripts/gen-dev-env.mjs                # creates or completes infra/.env, apps/api/.env, apps/app/.env and apps/worker/.env, and derives apps/api/.env.test; values are random and never printed
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml up -d postgres redis mailpit   # dev host ports 55432, 56379, 51025, 58025 (movable: DEV_*_PORT in infra/.env)
pnpm --filter @korbat/api dev               # http://localhost:3000/api/health; reads apps/api/.env
pnpm --filter @korbat/worker dev            # the image worker; reads apps/worker/.env and works on .data/media
pnpm --filter @korbat/app web               # http://localhost:8081
```

Emails sent in development (sign-in codes, new-device alerts, lockout notices) land in Mailpit at http://localhost:58025. Locally the web app uses Cloudflare's always-pass Turnstile test key, so the human check never blocks you.

The data services are PostgreSQL 18 and Valkey (the BSD-licensed fork of Redis, still under the service name `redis`, on its own volume `valkeydata`: Valkey 9 cannot read the RDB format 12 that Redis 7.4 wrote into the old `redisdata` volume, which held only transient state and can be removed with `docker volume rm`). Valkey needs the password from `infra/.env`; `gen-dev-env` writes it into the API's `REDIS_URL` too, so an older `.env` is fixed by running it again.

korbat once ran MinIO and never used it. Images live on two Docker volumes instead, `media-uploads` and `media-store`. If an old stack left a `korbat_miniodata` volume behind, `docker volume rm korbat_miniodata` removes it.

## Tests
```bash
pnpm test                                     # unit tests of every package
node scripts/test-db.mjs                      # creates or migrates the korbat_test database; run it again after adding a migration
pnpm --filter @korbat/api test:integration    # needs postgres, redis and mailpit up
```

Integration tests have their own database, `korbat_test`, and their own Redis database, 15. Both are named in `apps/api/.env.test`, which `node scripts/gen-dev-env.mjs` derives from `apps/api/.env`. Every run starts by emptying them, and refuses to start if a URL points anywhere else, so tests never touch development data.

Before they had their own database, the integration suites left accounts, profiles and posts in the development database, and the smoke test still leaves one account per run. To see and remove them:

```bash
node scripts/clean-dev-fixtures.mjs          # lists test accounts and profiles without an account; deletes nothing
node scripts/clean-dev-fixtures.mjs --yes    # deletes them with everything they made
```

It only matches emails of the tests' shape, `<word>-<uuid>@korbat.local`, recomputes the counters of kept profiles and posts they touched, and refuses to run unless `API_APP_ORIGIN` in `infra/.env` is a localhost origin.

## Full stack
```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml up -d --build   # http://localhost:8080
node scripts/smoke-auth-stack.mjs --base http://localhost:8080 --mailpit http://localhost:58025 --terms draft-2026-09 -- docker compose -f infra/compose.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml
```

The smoke test signs up a throwaway account through Caddy, reads its code from Mailpit, posts and reads the post back from the public Latest timeline. It uploads a JPEG carrying a GPS position, posts it, and checks that the served file is a fresh WebP without metadata, that a symlink planted in the store from inside the worker gets a 404, and that deleting the post removes the image from disk. It checks the worker's isolation, then grants the account a staff role with the CLI and checks that its session was revoked.

After every sharp upgrade, add `--worst-case`: it also uploads flat-colour files at the pixel caps (48 MP 16-bit interlaced PNG, 48 MP progressive JPEG, 48 MP GIF, 16 MP AVIF), expects each to be ready without the worker being OOM-killed or restarted, and prints the worker's memory peak.

Caddy listens on 8080 inside its container as its own user, proxies `/api` to the API and serves the web app with the page's security headers; `index.html` is revalidated on every load and the hashed bundles are cached for a year. The compose file keeps cloudflared, Caddy, the API and the data services on separate networks, so cloudflared reaches only Caddy and Caddy only the API.

## Upgrading PostgreSQL

The stack runs PostgreSQL 18 on the `pgdata18` volume. A database from the earlier PostgreSQL 16 volume (`pgdata`) is moved by:

```bash
node scripts/pg-major-upgrade.mjs -- docker compose -f infra/compose.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml
```

It dumps the old cluster with the old image in a throwaway container, starts the new server, restores the dump with every owner kept, and compares the row counts. The old volume stays until you remove it; the test database is created again by `node scripts/test-db.mjs`.

## Restoring

Restore the database and the `media-store` volume from the same moment. The API's sweeper deletes images that have no row: after a database restored from an older snapshot it would delete every image posted since. It refuses when there are many such images, but for a restore window set `MEDIA_RECONCILE=off` in `infra/.env` before starting the API, and put it back to `on` once the store matches the database. `force` makes one pass delete them anyway, for when they really are orphans.

## Posting and feed
Text posts up to 1000 characters, replies, quotes, likes, reposts and bookmarks; follows, blocks and mutes; a chronological Following timeline and a public Latest timeline; threads and profile pages. The web app's home is the timeline; sign-in lives at `/signin`.

- **Reading signed out:** Latest, threads and profiles are public. Following, bookmarks, likes, follower lists and privacy settings need a session.
- **Blocks** are enforced in every query, not just the interface: neither account sees the other while signed in, follows are removed both ways, and the blocked side gets `not_found` so nothing is revealed. Posts are public, so a block does not hide them from someone who signs out; the interface says so.
- **Mutes** are one-way and silent, and hide an account from your timelines only.
- **Liker lists are never exposed.** Counts are public; likes and bookmarks are private to their owner.
- **Write limits** per account, tiered by account age: in the first 24 hours 5 posts and 20 replies an hour and no reposts or quotes for 48 hours; afterwards 30 posts and 60 replies an hour. Everyone: 100 likes an hour, 50 follows an hour and 400 a day, 30 blocks or mutes an hour. Undo actions are never limited.
- **Deleting** blanks the text in the database and leaves a tombstone only where a thread or a quote needs it. There is no editing.

## Images
Posts, replies and quotes can carry up to four images, and every image needs a description of up to 1000 characters. The web composer takes JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF and still GIF files up to 20 MB, and refuses HEIC with advice to export a JPEG.

- **Nothing of the original is kept.** The upload goes to the `media-uploads` volume, a separate worker container decodes it and writes fresh WebP files in two sizes (1024 and 2048 pixels on the long side) without any metadata to `media-store`, and the original is deleted once the image is ready.
- **The worker is boxed in.** It has no network, no credentials and no capabilities, runs as a non-root user on a read-only file system within 768 MiB, one CPU and 64 processes, and only reads `media-uploads`. Decoders outside the allowlist are blocked, and the pixel count is checked from the header before decoding: 50 MP, 16 MP for AVIF, 16383 pixels on a side.
- **Formats can be switched off** without a deploy, for example while a codec advisory is open: remove it from `MEDIA_FORMATS` in `infra/.env` and restart `api` and `worker`.
- **Who sees an image** follows its post: anyone for a visible post, with a public five-minute cache; only the author for a withheld or removed post, never cached; nobody once the post is deleted, and its files leave the disk.
- **Behind Cloudflare**, set Browser Cache TTL to "Respect Existing Headers", or browsers keep images for four hours whatever the server says.

## Staff roles
No API endpoint changes roles. Run this on the server:
```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml run --rm api node dist/grant-role.js <email> <user|moderator|admin>
```
Every session of the account is revoked and the change is written to the audit log. Staff tools refuse moderators and admins until they turn on two-factor authentication.

## Profile and account
Signed-in accounts manage themselves under Settings; every route below needs the session and, where it says fresh, a re-authentication within five minutes (the app opens its panel when the API answers `reauth_required`).
- **Profile.** `PATCH /api/me/profile` sets the display name (up to 50 characters) and the bio (one line, up to 160). `POST /api/me/handle` (fresh) changes the handle once every 30 days; every handle an account ever had stays reserved for it in `handle_history`, so nobody else can take an old handle and the account can go back to it. There is no redirect from an old handle.
- **Email.** `POST /api/auth/email/change/start` (fresh) sends a code to the new address; `POST /api/auth/email/change/verify` moves the account there and tells the old address, whose notice carries a link (`/email-revert/<token>`, `POST /api/auth/email/revert`, valid 24 hours, once) that moves the account back, signs out every session and drops any password or two-factor secret set since the change. Sessions stay signed in after a change.
- **Verified badge.** Proof of holding a phone number, kept only as a keyed hash; one number per account. `VERIFY_PROVIDER` picks who sends the text: `off` (default; the badge is hidden), `dev` (the code is always `000000`; refused in production) or `vonage` (Vonage Verify v2 with `VONAGE_API_KEY`, `VONAGE_API_SECRET` and `VERIFY_BRAND`; the runbook is section 13 of `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-account-lifecycle-1b-design.md`, and `node scripts/verify-badge.mjs +4479xxxxxxxx` checks live credentials without touching an account). Routes: `POST /api/auth/badge/start`, `POST /api/auth/badge/verify`, `DELETE /api/auth/badge` (all fresh); starts are limited per account, per number, per IP and instance-wide (200 texts a day), and a flow takes at most five codes. The web build shows the badge section only with `WEB_BADGE=on` in `infra/.env` (the default is off, matching `API_VERIFY_PROVIDER=off`); set both together.
- **Data export.** `POST /api/account/export` (fresh, once a day) streams a ZIP with `export.json` (the account, profile, posts, likes, reposts, bookmarks, following, blocks, mutes, sessions, devices and security events) and every image the account uploaded under `media/`. Nothing is kept on the server: the archive is written entry by entry (ZIP64 when it passes 4 GiB or 65,535 entries), `export.json` is read in pages and streamed last, image files go through the media module's checked open, a request that fails before the first byte gives the day's export back, and one that fails midway breaks the download instead of saving a truncated archive.
- **Deletion.** `POST /api/account/delete/start` (fresh) mails a code; `POST /api/account/delete/confirm` with the code and the handle typed by the owner deletes the account at once: every session is revoked, posts become tombstones with their images and any pending uploads deleted from disk, likes, reposts, bookmarks, follows, blocks and mutes go with their counters, the profile is anonymised and keeps its handle, and the auth row is anonymised. The `account-purge` job (every five minutes) finishes any deletion the process did not. Nothing can be undone.
## Before going public
Set these in `infra/.env`:
- `API_APP_ORIGIN` to the public origin, for example `https://korbat.example`; the API refuses a plain-http origin in production.
- `API_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` and `WEB_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` to the keys of one Turnstile widget; the API and the web build refuse Cloudflare's test keys in production.
- `API_SMTP_URL` and `API_MAIL_FROM` to the EU mail relay; a plain `smtp://` relay must offer STARTTLS, which the API requires in production.
- `KORBAT_ENV=production` before building the images; it is the API's `NODE_ENV` too, so the guards above are on.
- `TUNNEL=on` and `API_TRUST_PROXY=cloudflare` when cloudflared is the only way in (the tunnel's hostname points at `http://caddy:8080`); `TUNNEL=off` and `API_TRUST_PROXY=caddy` when Caddy's port is reachable directly. With `on`, Caddy keeps `CF-Connecting-IP` for the API; with `off` it drops it, so nobody can claim an address.
- In Cloudflare, set Browser Cache TTL to "Respect Existing Headers", or browsers keep images for four hours whatever the server says.

Keep `API_AUTH_HMAC_KEY`, `API_IP_HASH_KEY` and `API_TOTP_ENC_KEY` secret and backed up. Losing `API_TOTP_ENC_KEY` breaks every enrolled authenticator. To rotate it, put the old key in `API_TOTP_ENC_KEYS_PREVIOUS` and a new `v2:` key in `API_TOTP_ENC_KEY`; each secret is re-encrypted with the new key when it is next used.

## Dependency audit

`pnpm audit --audit-level high` runs in CI. Two lower advisories are accepted, both in build-time tools that never see untrusted input here: `esbuild` 0.18 under drizzle-kit's config loader (its development server, which nothing starts) and `uuid` 7 under Expo's Xcode config plugin. Renovate moves them with their parents.

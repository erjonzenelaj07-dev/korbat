# korbat

Pseudonymous social platform with a narrow public rulebook and transparent moderation. Self-hosted.

- Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-03-korbat-design.md`
- Accounts and sessions (sub-project 1a): `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-identity-auth-1a-design.md`
- Plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/`

## Dev quick start
```bash
pnpm install
node scripts/gen-dev-env.mjs                # creates or completes infra/.env, apps/api/.env and apps/app/.env; values are random and never printed
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml up -d postgres redis minio minio-init mailpit   # dev host ports 55432, 56379, 59000, 59001, 51025, 58025
pnpm --filter @korbat/api dev               # http://localhost:3000/api/health
pnpm --filter @korbat/app web               # http://localhost:8081
```

Emails sent in development (sign-in codes, new-device alerts, lockout notices) land in Mailpit at http://localhost:58025. Locally the web app uses Cloudflare's always-pass Turnstile test key, so the human check never blocks you.

## Full stack
```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml up -d --build   # http://localhost:8080
node scripts/smoke-auth-stack.mjs --base http://localhost:8080 --mailpit http://localhost:58025 --terms draft-2026-09 -- docker compose -f infra/compose.yml -f infra/compose.dev.yml
```

The smoke test signs up a throwaway account through Caddy, reads its code from Mailpit, grants it a staff role with the CLI and checks that its session was revoked.

## Staff roles
No API endpoint changes roles. Run this on the server:
```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose.yml run --rm api node dist/grant-role.js <email> <user|moderator|admin>
```
Every session of the account is revoked and the change is written to the audit log. Staff tools refuse moderators and admins until they turn on two-factor authentication.

## Before going public
Set these in `infra/.env`:
- `API_APP_ORIGIN` to the public origin, for example `https://korbat.example`.
- `API_TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` and `WEB_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` to the keys of one Turnstile widget.
- `API_SMTP_URL` and `API_MAIL_FROM` to the EU mail relay.

Keep `API_AUTH_HMAC_KEY`, `API_IP_HASH_KEY` and `API_TOTP_ENC_KEY` secret and backed up. Losing `API_TOTP_ENC_KEY` breaks every enrolled authenticator.
